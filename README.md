# CIS5190-final-project
Team member: Ziyao Wang, Yuhao Jia, Hanzhi Zhang

We based our project on a Kaggle codebase “Advanced Stock Prediction using SVR, RFR, KNN, LSTM, GRU” (https://www.kaggle.com/code/ysthehurricane/advanced-stock-pred-using-svr-rfr-knn-lstm-gru/notebook). In this project, we tried to compare performance of deep learning models and linear regression model about stock price. Our study demonstrates that deep learning models exhibit a slight improvement in predictive accuracy when compared with the baseline model. Also, we successfully reduced model overfitting, leading to a significant improvement in testing set scores.
